Figuratively speaking, he was not shadow boxing, but beating his body black and blue to bring it into slavery lest he should become a cast away (1 Corinthians 9:26-27).</br>
<em>He considered his body an <b>enemy</b></em> with which he <b>must</b> contend in mortal combat to keep it under control by self-denial, abstinence, and severe mortification. (Romans 8:12-13; Colossians 3:5-10). He acted to keep the body as a slave to the soul, not permitting  the soul to be the slave of the body. He did this constantly lest after he had preached to others he would become a castaway.</p>
