                  <li>Be as earnest to make heaven as men are to win a race (Hebrews 12:1-3, Galatians 2:2, Galatians 5:7, Philippians 2:16, Philippians 3:14)</li>
                  <li><u>Be temperate in all things</u> (2 Peter 1:4-10). This refers to the months of severe training before a contest of wrestling or fighting with an opponent.</li>
                  <li>Fight with absolute confidence in victory (1 Corinthians 9:26, 1 Corinthians 4:9, 1 Corinthians 15:32, 1 Timothy 6:12, 2 Timothy 4:7). Fighting was done by leather bands on the hands studded with pieces of metal.</li>
                  <li><u>Keep the body under and bring it into dubjection</u>(1 Corinthians 9:27, Romans 6:14-23, Romans 8:12-13, Romans 12:1-2, 1 Corinthians 3:16-17)</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Now every athlete who [goes into training and] competes in the games is disciplined and exercises self-control in all things. They do it to win a crown that withers, but we [do it to receive] an imperishable [crown that cannot wither].

Figuratively speaking, he was not shadow boxing, but beating his body black and blue to bring it into slavery lest he should become a cast away (1 Corinthians 9:26-27).</br>
<em>He considered his body an <b>enemy</b></em> with which he <b>must</b> contend in mortal combat to keep it under control by self-denial, abstinence, and severe mortification. (Romans 8:12-13; Colossians 3:5-10). He acted to keep the body as a slave to the soul, not permitting  the soul to be the slave of the body. He did this constantly lest after he had preached to others he would become a castaway.</p>
