                  <li>Be as earnest to make heaven as men are to win a race (<a href="#verse1">Hebrews 12:1-3</a>, <a href="#">Galatians 2:2</a>, <a href="#">Galatians 5:7</a>, <a href="#">Philippians 2:16</a>, <a href="#">Philippians 3:14</a>)</li>
                  <li><u>Be temperate in all things</u> (2 Peter 1:4-10). This refers to the months of severe training before a contest of wrestling or fighting with an opponent.</li>
                  <li>Fight with absolute confidence in victory (1 Corinthians 9:26, 1 Corinthians 4:9, 1 Corinthians 15:32, 1 Timothy 6:12, 2 Timothy 4:7). Fighting was done by leather bands on the hands studded with pieces of metal.</li>
                  <li><u>Keep the body under and bring it into subjection</u>(1 Corinthians 9:27, Romans 6:14-23, Romans 8:12-13, Romans 12:1-2, 1 Corinthians 3:16-17)</li>

                <p>Now every athlete who [goes into training and] competes in the games is disciplined and exercises self-control in all things. They do it to win a crown that withers, but we [do it to receive] an imperishable [crown that cannot wither].

                </svg>Gr. hupopiazo, to strike one under the eye; to beat black and blue (here and Luke 18:5). This is Paul's explanation of how he was boxing. Figuratively speaking, he was not shadow boxing, but beating his body black and blue to bring it into slavery lest he should become a cast away (1 Corinthians 9:26-27).</br>
<em>He considered his body an <b>enemy</b></em> with which he <b>must</b> contend in mortal combat to keep it under control by self-denial, abstinence, and severe mortification. (Romans 8:12-13; Colossians 3:5-10). He acted to keep the body as a slave to the soul, not permitting  the soul to be the slave of the body. He did this constantly lest after he had preached to others he would become a castaway.</p>
